            If you don’t have a viral video to springboard you into millions of followers, you’ll need to start at the beginning.
            That means figuring out how you want to show up on Instagram. Remember, the “you” you put on Instagram is your brand. So your online identity needs to feel (and be!) authentic — your followers will know if it isn’t.
            Branding can be an in-depth process. Here are five steps to defining your personal brand and some questions you can use as prompts.
            Step one: Define your goals
Without clear goals, you won’t be able to measure your success. Start by thinking about why you’re pursuing Instafame.
Step two: Find your differentiator
Next, consider what sets you apart from your competition. No matter your specialty, you’re probably entering a crowded market. Why should someone follow you instead of someone else?
            Once you know your differentiator use it to target the niche audience that makes the most sense for your brand.
            Niche followers are often fiercely loyal. 
            Step three: Write down your narrative
Your backstory is where you say who you are and what you care about. People remember emotionally-driven stories more than facts. Plus, staying on point with your copy is easier when you have a brand story to refer back to.
Step four: Define your personality
You want your content to be consistent and recognizable. That means each post should reflect your brand’s personality in some way. Are you trying to inspire your followers? Teach them? Amuse them?
Step five: Craft your personal brand statement
A personal brand statement is a short, catchy statement you can refer back to while creating your content. Externally, it can act as an elevator pitch.

            2)Understand your target audience and what they want.<br>

            1. Don't Buy Followers
Okay so before we dive into exactly how to get more followers on Spotify and what you should do, let's talk about what not to do.
Whatever you do, don't pay for Spotify plays or followers.
It's a desperate attempt to unnaturally inflate the numbers on your profile which really doesn't help anyone.
If you want to increase your chances of getting your music featured on algorithmic Spotify playlists like the Discover Weekly Playlist, Release Radar, and more, gaining followers is a really positive signal to Spotify that they should notice you.
It's a form of engagement that boosts the algorithm and assists in the growth of promoting your music to more people on Spotify.
However.They have to be real people.
2. Promote Your Spotify On Social Media
If you are looking to increase your Spotify followers, it's important to utilize your existing platforms and audience.
Your potential listeners and followers are already waiting in the wings on social media.
Start funneling your audience into these streaming platforms and turn from social media followers into Spotify followers.
You need to hit this hard and make it super obvious where fans are meant to go, and what they are meant to do.
Your email signature, Instagram bio, YouTube descriptions... everywhere.
